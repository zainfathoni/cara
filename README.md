# Cara

My ways of working with coding agents.

## What This Provides

- `ralph/ralph.sh` - an execution-only Agent Queue runner.
- `ralph/PROMPT.md` - the shared prompt used by Ralph work sessions.
- `ralph/init.sh` - a plan-then-apply onboarding script for new or existing repositories.
- `ralph/github-blockers.sh` - audits, syncs, and checks real GitHub blocked-by relationships.
- `ralph/templates/docs/agents/*` - repo-local documentation templates consumed by global skills and Ralph.
- `skills/*` - reusable personal skills that can be installed globally by symlink.

## Workflow Contract

Planning and triage are maintainer-initiated steps. `/prototype` is model-invoked so `/wayfinder` can use it directly, but Ralph must not initiate it.

- `/to-spec` creates spec issues.
- `/to-tickets` breaks a spec into tracer-bullet tickets with blocking edges.
- `/wayfinder` plans large work as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, resolved one at a time.
- `/prototype` answers one unclear logic or UI question with throwaway code, then retains that primary source outside main. Model-invoked so `/wayfinder` can use it directly.
- `/handoff` carries context to another harness, directory, colleague, or side task when continuing in place is not possible.
- `/triage` evaluates readiness and applies triage labels.

Ralph starts after triage. It only consumes issues already marked `ready-for-agent`. It also treats GitHub's issue dependency graph as the canonical blocker source: issues with open `blockedBy` dependencies are not eligible for execution.

If upstream skills create issues with `ready-for-agent-triage`, treat that as a planning/triage queue label. It does not make an issue eligible for Ralph until the repository's triage labels map the issue to `ready-for-agent`.

## Onboard A Repository

From the target repository:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/init.sh
```

To apply without the interactive confirmation:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/init.sh --yes
```

If the repository uses a GitHub Project dashboard, pass it explicitly:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/init.sh --project-owner zainfathoni --project-number 6
```

The init script creates or updates repo-local `docs/agents/*`, creates missing canonical labels, and creates local-only Ralph symlinks ignored through `.git/info/exclude`.

## Run Ralph

After onboarding, run from the target repository:

```bash
./ralph.sh
```

Debug resolved configuration without invoking an agent:

```bash
./ralph.sh --dry-run
```

Run exactly one iteration:

```bash
./ralph.sh 1
```

Force one issue while still validating all Agent Queue rules:

```bash
RALPH_ISSUE=168 ./ralph.sh 1
```

## Blocked-by Relationships

Markdown `Blocked by: #123` lines are documentation only. GitHub's real issue dependency graph is the canonical blocker source. Use the helper to audit or repair repositories where markdown blockers may not have matching GitHub relationships:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/github-blockers.sh audit --repo OWNER/REPO --state all
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/github-blockers.sh sync --repo OWNER/REPO --state all
```

Before Ralph claims work, it must verify the selected issue has no open real blockers:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/ralph/github-blockers.sh check-issue --repo OWNER/REPO --issue 168
```

## Environment

Common overrides:

- `RALPH_WORKSPACE` - target repository path.
- `RALPH_REPO` - GitHub repository, such as `OWNER/REPO`.
- `RALPH_PROJECT_OWNER` - GitHub Project owner when a Project is configured.
- `RALPH_PROJECT_NUMBER` - GitHub Project number when a Project is configured.
- `RALPH_RUNNER` - `opencode` or `claude`.
- `RALPH_MODEL` - optional runner model override.
- `RALPH_ISSUE` - optional forced issue number, still validated by the prompt.
- `RALPH_NOTE` - runtime note appended to the prompt.
- `RALPH_BRANCH_PREFIX` - issue branch prefix, default `agent/issue-`.
- `RALPH_AUTO_APPROVE` - default `1`; set `0` to avoid permission auto-approval.
- `RALPH_DRY_RUN` - default `0`; set `1` to print resolved config and exit before invoking an agent.
- `RALPH_PRINT_CONFIG_ONLY` - default `0`; set `1` to print resolved config and exit before invoking an agent.

When present, `docs/agents/ralph.md` supplies default values for `RALPH_REPO`, `RALPH_PROJECT_OWNER`, `RALPH_PROJECT_NUMBER`, and `RALPH_BRANCH_PREFIX`. Environment variables override those repo-local defaults.

## Repository Docs

Each onboarded repository should commit:

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`
- `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`
- `docs/agents/domain.md`
- `docs/agents/ralph.md`

These files adapt the global skills and shared Ralph runner to the local repository. They are not an issue tracker or backlog.

## Install Shared Skills

After cloning this repo, bootstrap the `/sync-skills` skill once:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/install.sh
```

Then invoke `/sync-skills` for all future updates and audits. It fast-forwards this repository, runs both scripts below, cleans up deprecated skills, and verifies the installation.

For manual control or troubleshooting, the underlying scripts are:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/update-upstream.sh
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/install.sh
```

`skills/update-upstream.sh` installs a release-pinned allowlist of upstream-tracked skills, including `shadcn/improve`, and intentionally excludes local-owned `teach`, so pulling this repo does not depend on a human remembering which upstream skills are safe to update. Upstream `wizard` remains blocked pending local file/repository mutation hardening.

By default this symlinks the small global selection documented in
[`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) into `~/.agents/skills`. Pass skill names
to install an explicit project-local or optional selection, and set
`AGENT_SKILLS_DIR` to install somewhere else.

Upstream skills are installed for Amp, Claude Code, and Codex by default. Set `UPSTREAM_SKILLS_AGENTS` to a space-separated subset when a machine needs fewer targets.

## Script Safety

This repo uses [destructive_command_guard](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard) scan config in `.dcg/hooks.toml` and CI in `.github/workflows/dcg-scan.yml` to catch destructive commands added to shell scripts and workflows.

For local checks, install `dcg` through machine configuration when possible (for example, the `nix-home` Home Manager setup tracked in [nix-home#3](https://github.com/zainfathoni/nix-home/issues/3)) and run:

```bash
dcg scan --paths skills/ .github/workflows/ --fail-on error
```
