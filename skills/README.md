# Cara Skills

Cara owns these skill sources even when a skill is installed only for one project.

## Workflow Skills

- `fizzy` - manage Fizzy boards, cards, steps, comments, reactions, and pins. Card descriptions must be authored as HTML and card relationships must be linked.
- `sync-skills` - synchronize global skill installations across machines: update upstream skills, clean up deprecated ones, install local-owned shared skills, and verify the result. The single entry point for setting up or auditing any machine.
- `log-notes` - log completed agent work into iCloud-synced Obsidian daily notes and relevant topical/project notes.
- `squash-commits` - prepare a chronological rebase guide and, when explicitly authorized, execute and verify the guided squash.
- `pr-e2e-evidence` - collect repo-agnostic PR QA evidence: E2E results, browser verification notes, report screenshots, before/after screenshots, and PR description updates.
- `managing-dev-environments` - prepare, inspect, and release development runtimes and task-owned browser sessions. Complements `pr-e2e-evidence`; release means teardown, not deployment. Concrete commands and environment permissions remain repo-owned.
- `show-me` - render topic-oriented visuals as diagrams, pseudocode, file trees, and focused HTML artifacts.
- `hey-cli-second-identity` - give one agent its own HEY account through the hey CLI without clobbering the operator's login: keyring-collision workaround, wrapper-carried credentials, agent-side verification, and the calendar gotchas.
- `teach` - stateful, multi-session teaching workspace (mission, lessons, reference docs, learning records, reusable workspace assets, workspace-owned hosting docs). Vendored from Matt Pocock's AI Hero ([learn-anything-with-my-teach-skill](https://www.aihero.dev/learn-anything-with-my-teach-skill)) and tracked here so local modifications are version-controlled. Local changes: codebase lessons link source references via `vscode://file/<path>:<line>` deep links and pinned GitHub permalinks; lesson hosting is documented per workspace.

BookThatApp-specific operational skills are maintained in the owner's private notes repository and are not shipped by Cara.

`teach` is local-owned. Do not overwrite it with `npx skills add mattpocock/skills`; compare upstream changes in a separate grilling session and selectively port only the accepted parts.

When comparing `teach` with upstream, treat upstream as input, not authority: adopt upstream changes only when they improve the teaching model without weakening the local delta. Preserve the local delta unless a grilling decision explicitly retires it: source-derived workspace directories, reusable workspace assets as the default architecture, static/offline hosting portability, per-workspace hosting docs, codebase source chips with both VS Code deep links and pinned GitHub permalinks, optional Tailscale serving helper, Tycho inquiry feedback loops, and the committed local templates/scripts under `skills/teach/`.

Use globally installed upstream skills alongside these shared skills. Upstream-tracked skills are installed from their source repositories and may accept upstream breaking changes, including renames and removal of deprecated skills.

- `ask-matt` - route to the appropriate upstream user-invoked skill.
- `domain-modeling` - maintain durable domain language and ADRs while decisions are made.
- `grill-with-docs` - user-invoked wrapper that runs `grilling` with `domain-modeling`.
- `codebase-design` - shared deep-module vocabulary for architecture and interface decisions.
- `diagnosing-bugs` - renamed upstream replacement for `diagnose`.
- `writing-for-agents` - model-invoked reference for skills, agent instructions, and other documents agents consume. Renamed upstream from `writing-great-skills`.
- `resolving-merge-conflicts` - resolve in-progress git merge or rebase conflicts.
- `handoff` - compact a long session into a handoff document before switching agents or tasks.
- `grill-me` - stateless user-invoked grilling when no working directory should retain the result.
- `to-questionnaire` - turn an external decision gap into a questionnaire for the person who can answer it.
- `wait-what` - re-pitch one message that did not land with enough context and plain language.

- `grilling` - reusable interview loop for stress-testing plans and designs. Distinguishes facts (found by exploring the codebase) from decisions (the user must decide), asks one question at a time, and waits for confirmation before enacting any plan.
- `prototype` - answer one logic or UI question with throwaway code, retaining the primary source on a `prototype/*` branch outside main. Model-invoked so `/wayfinder` can use it directly.
- `to-spec` - turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker. No interview — just synthesizes what you've already discussed. Renamed from `to-prd`.
- `to-tickets` - break a plan, spec, or conversation into tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges. Works as a local `tickets.md` file or native tracker blocking links. Merged from `to-plan` and `to-issues`.
- `implement` - build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving TDD at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review` before committing.
- `wayfinder` - plan a huge chunk of work as a shared map of investigation tickets on the issue tracker — research, grilling, prototype, and task tickets linked with blocking relationships, resolved one at a time until the route is clear.
- `research` - investigate a question against primary sources and capture findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- `code-review` - two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point: Standards (coding standards plus a Fowler refactoring-smell baseline) and Spec (faithfulness to the originating spec or ticket), run as parallel sub-agents.
- `tdd` - test-driven development reference material: red-green loop with refactoring moved to the code-review phase. Now reference-only so AFK agents can work autonomously.
- `improve-codebase-architecture`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, and `triage` - upstream engineering workflow skills.
- `improve` - audit a codebase, produce a prioritized improvement plan, and execute or reconcile that plan. Installed from [`shadcn/improve`](https://github.com/shadcn/improve).
- `tycho` - manage Tycho-monitored projects and managed agents: create/list/run/stop/send/archive/clone agents, control schedules. Installed from [`firewalker06/tycho`](https://github.com/firewalker06/tycho).
- `typesafe-ai` - build AI features with TypeSafe System One models (Jev): typed judgments and probabilities that code composes, instead of prompt-and-parse steps. Model-invoked; reads the live docs at `docs.typesafe.ai` as its source of truth. Installed from [`typesafe-ai/skills`](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills).

Deprecated or replaced upstream skills such as `writing-great-skills`, `ubiquitous-language`, `design-an-interface`, `qa`, `request-refactor-plan`, `caveman`, `zoom-out`, `to-prd`, `to-issues`, and `to-plan` should remain uninstalled unless they become local-owned skills with explicit documented behavior.

Upstream `wizard` is deliberately uninstalled. Its v1.2.3 model-invoked template permits an unconstrained `ENV_FILE` and ambient GitHub repository writes; see [ADR 005](../docs/decisions/005-defer-upstream-wizard.md).

Do not treat prototype code as production code unless a human explicitly promotes it into an implementation task.

The lifecycle flow is: Grilling → Spec → Tickets → Implement → Code Review. Start with `/grill-with-docs` (or `/wayfinder` for genuinely multi-session decision maps), generate a spec with `/to-spec`, break it into tickets with `/to-tickets`, implement each ticket with `/implement`, and review with `/code-review`.

Reference: [Skills Changelog v1.2: /wait-what, /writing-for-agents, Claude Code Plugin, and more](https://www.aihero.dev/skills/skills-changelog-v12-wait-what-writing-for-agents-claude-code-plugin-and-more). The installer pins the audited v1.2.3 patch tag.

## Install

After cloning this repo, bootstrap the default global selection once:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/install.sh
```

Then invoke `/sync-skills` for all future updates and audits. It fast-forwards this repository, runs both scripts below, cleans up deprecated skills, and verifies the installation.

For manual control or troubleshooting, the underlying scripts are:

```bash
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/update-upstream.sh
~/Code/GitHub/zainfathoni/cara/skills/install.sh
```

`update-upstream.sh` uses explicit allowlists for Matt Pocock's skills, `shadcn/improve`, `firewalker06/tycho`, and `typesafe-ai/skills`, and intentionally excludes local-owned `teach`. Matt's package is pinned to the audited v1.2.3 tag. Before changing an installation, the script audits other Amp discovery roots: competing copies and broken or different-target links stop the update because source selection is ambiguous, while exact symlink aliases are accepted and the retired `write-a-skill` is reported without blocking unrelated updates. The audit preserves every inspected path for an explicit owner decision. The updater then removes deprecated and blocked skills, installs the allowlist, validates copied context pointers and Claude/Codex invocation metadata, and verifies lock provenance. By default it copies skills for `amp`, `claude-code`, and `codex`; Amp and Codex share the Agent Skills root used by the Skills CLI. Override the agent set with a whitespace-separated subset, such as `UPSTREAM_SKILLS_AGENTS="amp claude-code"`; other agent IDs are rejected.

The copied multi-agent installation remains authoritative. Do not install Matt's Claude Code plugin alongside it; that creates a second update path for the same skills.

`install.sh` symlinks a deliberately small default global selection: the six
review skills, `pr-e2e-evidence`, `managing-dev-environments`, `fizzy`,
`log-notes`, and `sync-skills`.

Occasional workflows such as `hey-cli-second-identity`, `show-me`,
`squash-commits`, and `teach` are optional. Install any explicit selection by
passing its names; no profile or alias layer is involved.

The default target remains `~/.agents/skills`; override it with
`AGENT_SKILLS_DIR`. Use `install.sh --list` to inspect the default selection
without changing anything. The installer touches only selected names, refuses
to overwrite a real directory or file, and replaces an existing symlink only
for a selected name. Foreign-owned and deselected entries are left alone.

Shell scripts under `setup/` and `skills/` are covered by destructive-command scanning. If you add or change a script, run `dcg scan --paths setup/ skills/ --fail-on error` when `dcg` is installed; CI also scans scripts and workflows. Prefer installing `dcg` through machine configuration rather than an ad-hoc local installer when the machine is managed declaratively.

## Review Skills

All review skills default to a current-user **PENDING** review and never submit, publish, publicly reply, resolve, or delete review content without explicit instruction.

### Source-aware review skills

These handle review comments regardless of source — current-user pending drafts *or* teammate-visible threads — and apply source-specific safety internally:

- `self-review` - create or update a current-user PENDING review with inline comments.
- `review-address` - address review comments end-to-end (verify, fix, optionally reply), for pending drafts or teammate threads.
- `review-verify` - verify whether review comments were addressed before replying, resolving, clearing, or submitting.
- `review-clear` - delete current-user pending review artifacts only after explicit instruction.

### Teammate-facing review skills

Use these for colleague-facing review work where feedback may become visible when explicitly requested:

- `team-review` - review a teammate's PR; draft findings as a PENDING review first, submit only when asked.
- `team-review-resolve` - resolve verified teammate-visible review threads.

## Pending-first contract

Every skill above creates or updates a current-user PENDING review by default and treats publication as an explicit, opt-in step. Do not mix current-user pending-review cleanup (`review-clear`) with teammate-visible thread resolution (`team-review-resolve`) in the same step.
